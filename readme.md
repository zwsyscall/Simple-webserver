# Shrimple HTTP webserver written in in x86_64 assembly
Simple project done for practice, there are issues.

I intend to improve on this over time, but we'll see what actually happens.

10/10 experience, would do it again.

Currently supports:
 - Serving files up to 3996 bytes long.
 - Serves 404 to files missing (or ones without permissions)
